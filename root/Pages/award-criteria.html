        <i>Some things to consider when designing and showing your improvement:</i><br>
        •  Your experiments should be done with both the improved part and the original part as a control<br>
        •  The sequences of the new and existing parts must be different<br> 
        •  Adapting the part to a different assembly standard does not count as a functional improvement<br>
        •  See the <a href="https://2020.igem.org/Measurement">Measurement Hub</a> for details on how to measure your parts<br>
        •  You must document the improvement on the Registry on both the existing and new part pages. See the <a href="http://parts.igem.org/Help:Document_Parts">Registry Document Parts page</a> for instructions<br>
        <br>
        <i>Notes:</i><br>
        •  This criteria was kept in as an option for teams who could get into the lab.
